<p>Coding, also known as computer programming, is how we communicate with
  computers. Code instructs a computer on what actions to take, and
  writing code is similar to writing a set of instructions.
  Learning to write code allows you to tell computers what to do
  or how to behave in a much faster manner.</p>
